# Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian estimation is an approach for incorporating prior knowledge into the estimation of unknown parameters. 

The Bayesian philosophy represents a total shift from the Frequentist philosophy that we've seen so far in this class, and that you've seen in your other stats classes. An important distinction between the two philosophies lies in their beliefs about unknown parameters. In particular:

- Frequentists believe that parameters are unknown but *fixed constants*
- Bayesians believe that parametes are *random variables* (so they have a probability distribution)




## Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between the Frequentist and Bayesian philosophies
- Derive the posterior distribution for an unknown parameter based on a specified prior and likelihood
- Derive the Bayes estimator for a given loss function
- Evaluate the properties of Bayes estimators
- Understand the impact of the choice of prior on Bayesian estimation
