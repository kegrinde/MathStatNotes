# Welcome! {-}

Welcome to the course notes for *MATH/STAT 455: Mathematical Statistics* at Macalester College. These notes were created by [Kelsey Grinde](https://kegrinde.github.io/) and draw heavily from the course textbook: 

> *An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications* by Richard Larsen and Morris Marx (6th Edition)

**I will be editing and adding to these notes throughout Spring 2021, so please check back for updates!** 

If you find any typos or have other questions, please email kgrinde@macalester.edu.
