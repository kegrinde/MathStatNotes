Suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) represent independent flips of a coin (0 = tails, 1 = heads) with probability \\(0.7\\) of landing heads. If you flip a coin two times, what’s the probabiity of observing a tail and then a head (\\(X = 0, Y = 1\\))? In Mathematical Statistics, we will similarly write down a probability model but then we will use observed data to estimate the value of the parameters in that model. Suppose we flipped a coin two times and observed one tail and then one head. Would you be more willing to believe that the probability of getting a head (\\(p\\)) is 0.7 or 0.4? If \\(p\\) could be anywhere between 0 and 1, what’s your best guess about what that value of \\(p\\) is based on the observed data? There is more than one technique that you can use to estimate the value of an unknown parameter. You’re already familiar with one technique—least squares estimation—from STAT 155. We’ll review the ideas behind that approach, as well as explore two other widely used estimation techniques: maximum likelihood estimation and the method of moments. 2.1 Learning Goals Understand the distinction between common parameter estimation methods (e.g., least squares, maximum likelihood, method of moments) Be able to implement common parameter estimation methods in a variety of settings and models 2.2 Least Squares Estimation 2.2.1 (Optional) Textbook Reading Guide Read: Sections 11.1 and 11.2, through the definition of residuals (pages 520–523), and Section 3.4 in the Stat 155 Notes Definitions: method of least squares residual predicted/fitted value Questions: What is the intuition behind least squares estimation? What are the typical steps to find a least squares estimate? How can we use least squares estimation to estimate the slope and intercept of a simple linear regression model? (work through Theorem 11.2.1 in detail and fill in any steps that the textbook left out) 2.2.2 In-Class Notes and Activities See Day 1 Slides and Activity 1 on Moodle. 2.3 Maximum Likelihood Estimation 2.3.1 Textbook Reading Guide Read: Section 5.1 and the first half of Section 5.2 (pages 278–288) Definitions: parameter statistic/estimator estimate likelihood function – Definition 5.2.1 maximum likelihood estimate – Definition 5.2.2 log-likelihood Note: wherever applicable, you should write down definitions for important vocab both “in words” and in mathematical notation. Questions: What is the intuition behind the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach? What are the typical steps to find a MLE? (see Ex 5.2.1, 5.2.2, and Case Study 5.2.1; work through at least one of these examples in detail, filling in any steps that the textbook left out) Are there ever situations when the typical steps to finding a MLE don’t work? If so, what can we do instead to find the MLE? (see Ex 5.2.3, 5.2.4) How do the steps to finding a MLE change when we have more than one unknown parameter? (see Ex 5.2.5) 2.3.2 Videos MLE “by hand”: TBD MLE by numerical techniques: TBD 2.3.3 In-Class Notes and Activities MLE “by hand”: see Day 2 Slides and Activity 2 on Moodle. MLE by numerical techniques: see Day 3 Slides and Activity 3 on Moodle. 2.4 The Method of Moments 2.4.1 Textbook Reading Guide Read: the second half of Section 5.2 (pages 289–293) Definitions: theoretical moment sample moment method of moments estimates – Definition 5.2.3 Remember: wherever applicable, you should write down definitions for important vocab both “in words” and in mathematical notation. Questions: What is the intuition behind the method of moments (MOM) procedure for estimating unknown parameters? What are the typical steps to find a MOM estimator? (see Ex 5.2.6, 5.2.7, and Case Study 5.2.2; work through at least one of these examples in detail, filling in any steps that the textbook left out) What advantages does the MOM approach offer compared to MLE? Do the MOM and MLE approaches always yield the same estimate? (look through the examples in Section 5.2 and try using the other approach — do you always get the same answer?) 2.4.2 Videos TBD 2.4.3 In-Class Notes and Activities See Day 4 Slides and Activity 4 on Moodle.
