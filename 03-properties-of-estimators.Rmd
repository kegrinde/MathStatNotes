# Properties of Estimators

**Under Construction**

## Learning Goals

- Evaluate properties of different estimators (e.g., bias, efficiency, mean squared error, consistency)
- Understand the distinction between finite sample and asymptotic properties
- Use these properties to choose one type of estimator of another

## Finite Sample Properties

### Bias

### Variance

### MSE

## Asymptotic Properties

### Asymptotically Unbiased

### Consistency

### Asymptotic Normality
